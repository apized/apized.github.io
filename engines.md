# Engines

## Micronaut

[Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) is the default underlying engine for apized. The advantages of micronaut
provides that make it our default choice is the reflection free approach which will drastically improve startup times.
Apized is also fully compatible with native compilation, which means you can deploy light-weight ulta-performant native
binaries.

## Spring Boot

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is something we'd like to add in the future but we'd need the time
and resources to do so. This implementation will probably only happen if this projects gets wider adoption.
