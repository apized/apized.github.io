# apized 

A modern JVM-based framework designed to make API development easier. It aims to give
developers more time to focus on model definition and business logic implementation by automatically providing the
underlying implementations to easily create a rich REST API.

By adopting apized your API will provide:

- [Enhanced REST endpoints](/features?id=enhanced-rest-endpoints)
- [Audit trail](/features?id=audit-trail)
- [Event publishing](/features?id=event-publishing)
- [Behaviours](/features?id=behaviours)
- [Testing](/features?id=testing)
- [Documentation](/features?id=documentation) (optional)
- [Security](/features?id=security) (optional)
- [Federation](/features?id=federation) (optional)

and will run on top of:

- [Micronaut](/engines?id=micronaut) (default)
- [Spring Boot](/engines?id=spring-boot) (planned)
